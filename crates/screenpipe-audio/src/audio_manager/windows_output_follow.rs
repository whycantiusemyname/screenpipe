//! Windows "follow the audio" output capture + in-meeting speaker watchdog.
//!
//! ## Why
//!
//! On Windows, speaker capture is a WASAPI loopback on a specific render
//! endpoint. screenpipe captures the console default (plus the
//! eCommunications default), but apps can render anywhere: Zoom/Meet let
//! users pick an output device, Windows re-points defaults when USB devices
//! enumerate, and some defaults are do-nothing endpoints (a USB microphone's
//! headphone-monitor port). When meeting audio renders to an endpoint we
//! don't capture, the loopback hears pure silence — and a silent WASAPI
//! loopback delivers **no callbacks at all**, which is indistinguishable
//! from a healthy-but-quiet one. Result: mic transcripts flow, speaker
//! transcripts silently never appear (see "Speakers (Yeti Stereo
//! Microphone)" field reports).
//!
//! ## What
//!
//! Every device-monitor tick this module asks WASAPI which render endpoints
//! actually have audio activity (active sessions from other processes +
//! meter peaks — `list_render_endpoint_activity`) and:
//!
//! 1. **Follow**: in "Follow System Default" mode, starts loopback capture
//!    on any endpoint that has had an active render session for two
//!    consecutive ticks but isn't being captured. Capped, and torn down
//!    after the endpoint has been session-idle for a few minutes. A silent
//!    loopback costs nothing (no callbacks), so false positives are cheap.
//!
//! 2. **Watchdog**: when a meeting is detected AND audio is audibly
//!    rendering AND no speaker chunk has reached the pipeline, it first
//!    restarts output capture; if speaker audio still doesn't flow, it
//!    publishes `audio_capture_health_speaker_silent` so the app can notify
//!    the user *during* the meeting instead of them discovering a one-sided
//!    transcript afterwards.
//!
//! Decision logic is pure and platform-independent (unit-tested everywhere);
//! only the sweep that talks to WASAPI/AudioManager is Windows-gated.
